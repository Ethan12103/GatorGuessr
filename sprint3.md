# Sprint 3

## Work Completed

### Back-end

- We changed the user struct to include a score field which allows us to order users based on scores. The changes were migrated using the `db.AutoMigrate()` and automatically integrated into the MySql database.
- Added new endpoint for validating users for login
- Added new endpoint for getting users with top score
