<div class="container">
  <h1>Uh oh, this is awkward.</h1>
  <p>It looks like the page you're trying to reach doesn't exist.</p>
  <img
    src="https://media.tenor.com/FcVg5W9zZJQAAAAC/error.gif"
    alt="404 error"
  />
  <p>
    Maybe you mistyped the URL, or maybe the page has been abducted by aliens.
  </p>
  <p>In any case, we suggest you take a break and try again later.</p>
  <button mat-raised-button (click)="goBack()">Go back to safety</button>
