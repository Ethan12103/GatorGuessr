## Description

A website that hosts a game similar to GeoGuessr. It will spawn a user in
a random location within Gainesville and the user will have to guess where
they are on a map, and points will be rewarded based on how close their
guess was to their dropped off location.

## Requirements

To run the server, you must set `DB_PASSWORD` to be the password for the database you are using. If you are having trouble, please contact my cell at `786-614-1426` or email me at `matthew.deguzman0613@gmail.com`.
