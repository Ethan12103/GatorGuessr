## Project Name 
GatorGuessr

## Description
A website that hosts a game similar to GeoGuessr. It will spawn a user in 
a random location within Gainesville and the user will have to guess where 
they are on a map, and points will be rewarded based on how close their 
guess was to their dropped off location.
